Keyboard focus does not follow into expanded content

Recommended fix:

Make sure that the child options are placed as the next elements in the DOM.

Found on iOS.

Acceptance Criteria

Make sure that in the expanding and collapsing content the screen reader cursor travels from the parent control onto the expanded content, but not the next element after the content.
